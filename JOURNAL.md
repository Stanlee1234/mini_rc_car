## 10/18/2025 - Created the Github Repository and Created first image of car  

Hi! I started on my project, where I build a tiny RC car that can be 3d printed (mostly) and I just finished making the sides of the car! It looks like this:

Its not very good, but I will still try to make some improvements to it as it moves on. I am also working on the schematics of the motor control, which is taking some time (Because I am using tinkerCAD (idk how to use anything else)) right here:

it still looks kinda wonky because I am in the middle of testing something. Also the real car will not be using a Arduino, probally a small ESP32 and using relays + batteries. Anyways, Bye!
